## Mode C: Infinite Hell

- Infinite waves, each wave spawns **x random Bosses** (default 3, configurable, more bosses = more rewards)
- Each wave gets stronger
- Shop available for ammo resupply
- **If you're lucky enough to spawn bosses from different factions, a little strategy can let you reap the benefits of their infighting**
- Small reward every 5 successful waves, reach wave 100 for lifetime wealth!
- No more words needed, come fight if you need money. This mode drops no boxes, only cash rewards based on killed bosses. Perfect for combat lovers and impatient players
- Cash rewards scatter at the signpost after each wave, more waves completed = more cash scattered, giving visual satisfaction
