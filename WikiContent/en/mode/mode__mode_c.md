### Rewards (Cash Pool)
- This mode **does not drop boss loot boxes**

### Extra Rewards
- **Every 5 waves**: one extra reward drop near the signpost
- **Every 100 waves**: progressive milestone reward (crowns + cash), doubling each time:
  - Wave 100: 1 Crown + 10 million cash
  - Wave 200: 2 Crowns + 20 million cash
  - Wave 300: 4 Crowns + 40 million cash
  - And so on...

### Tips
- **If you're lucky enough to spawn bosses from different factions**, a little strategy can let you reap the benefits of their infighting
