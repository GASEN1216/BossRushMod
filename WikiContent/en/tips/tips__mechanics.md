## Challenge Mechanics

- All boss mechanics in this mod can be learned from Courier Awen
- Boss spawn points are at the edges of the arena, be careful when walking before spawn locations are determined
- After defeating each wave, you can choose to continue at the center, with about **15 seconds interval** to adjust  
- If random drops are enabled, boss loot boxes can be **picked up and placed** and can **block bullets** (configurable), meaning you can build your own defensive structures
- Supports custom bosses from all other mods
- You can leave anytime from the evacuation point on the right  
- **Death drops all your items**, but victory rewards are equally generous!
